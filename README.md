# Laplacian-Operator-Zero-crossing-points
Laplacian Operator Implementation: Detecting Image Features and Zero-Crossing Points for Enhanced Analysis

It is a program that implements the 3 × 3 Laplacian operator. The input image is “building.raw”. The output image is the zero-crossing points map.

This was an assignment that I did in my second to last semester(Fall 2023) for Image Processing Course (CS 425).
